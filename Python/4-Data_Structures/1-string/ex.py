"""
==> EX1 <==
Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.
==> EX2 <==
Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency)
in a string.
==> EX3 <==
Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and last 2 characters
of a given string. If the string length is less than 2, return the empty string instead.
==> EX4 <==
Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences
of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.
==> EX5 <==
Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated
by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.
==> EX6 <==
Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should
be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing', add 'ly' instead. If the
string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
==> EX7 <==
Write a Python program to find the first appearance of the substrings 'not' and
'poor' in a given string. If 'not' follows 'poor', replace the whole 'not'...'poor'
substring with 'good'. Return the resulting string.
==> EX8 <==
Write a Python function that takes a list of words and return the longest word
and the length of the longest one.
==> EX9 <==
Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string.
==> EX10 <==
Write a Python program to change a given string to a newly string where the
first and last chars have been exchanged.
==> EX11 <==
