==> EX2 <==
Write a Python program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius and Fahrenheit.
==> EX3 <==
Write a Python program to guess a number between 1 and 9.
==> EX4 <==
Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.
==> EX5 <==
Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverses it.
==> EX6 <==
Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers in a
series of numbers
==> EX7 <==
Write a Python program that prints each item and its corresponding type from
the following list.
==> EX8 <==
Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6.
Note : Use 'continue' statement.
==> EX9 <==
Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50.
Note : The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers :
==> EX10 <==
Write a Python program that iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of
three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz". For
numbers that are multiples of three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
==> EX11 <==
Write a Python program that takes two digits m (row) and n (column) as input
and generates a two-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th
column of the array should be i*j.
==> EX12 <==
Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of lines (blank line to
terminate) as input and prints the lines as output (all characters in lower case).
==> EX13 <==
Write a Python program that accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit
binary numbers as its input. The program will print the numbers that are divisible
by 5 in a comma separated sequence.
==> EX14 <==
Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculates the number of
digits and letters
==> EX15 <==
Write a Python program to check the validity of passwords input by users.
Validation :
        * At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
        * At least 1 number between [0-9].
        * At least 1 character from [$#@].
        * Minimum length 6 characters.
        * Maximum length 16 characters.
==> EX16 <==
Write a Python program to find numbers between 100 and 400 (both included)
where each digit of a number is an even number. The numbers obtained should
be printed in a comma-separated sequence.
==> EX17 <==
Write a Python program to print the alphabet pattern 'A'.
==> EX18 <==
Write a Python program to print the alphabet pattern 'D'.
==> EX19 <==
Write a Python program to print the alphabet pattern 'E'.

==> EX21 <==
Write a Python program to print the alphabet pattern 'L'.
==> EX22 <==
Write a Python program to calculate a dog's age in dog years.
Note: For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years. After that,
each dog year equals 4 human years
